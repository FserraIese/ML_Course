    "### Date and datetime\n",
    "\n",
    "In computer environments, there are typically two data types for time, called date and datetime. In **type date** we can store dates, that is, year, month and day. Most software applications for data management and analysis can deal with different date formats. The default format for dates in most languages, including Python, is `yyyy-mm-dd`. I advise you to use only this everywhere. Under the hood, a variable of type `date` is just a number, the number of days since a time origin, which is, typically, 1970-01-01 (in particular in Python). \n",
    "\n",
    "In data of **type datetime**, we store the same as in type date, plus hour, minute and second. The preferred format is `yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss`. Sometimes, an indication of the time zone is added at the end, as we will see below. Examples are CET (Central European Time), CEST (Central European Summer Time), GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) and UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). Datetime is also called **timestamp**. Under the hood, datetime is the number of seconds since the time origin.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data of type datetime can be managed in many ways in Python. The package `datetime` is recommended if you want to the deal with times one by one, not within a data frame. The functions `datetime.date` and `datetime.datetime` can be used to create dates and datetimes. The dates are just datetimes in disguise, that is, the date `1954-04-30` is the same as the datetime `1954-04-30 00:00:00`.\n",
    "\n",
    "The old date and datetime types became obsolete when the **type datetime64** was introduced in Numpy. In this data type, times are recorded down to the nanosecond,\n",
    "$$1\\ {\\rm nanosecond} = 10^{-9}\\ {\\rm seconds}.$$ \n",
    "\n",
    "So a datetime64 is just the number of nanoseconds since the time origin. Pandas inherits this from Numpy. My presentation here is very brief, and restricted to the management of times in Pandas data structures. So, I start by creating a series which contains a time as a string:"

    "Character classes get more powerful when complemented with **quantifiers**. For instance, followed by a plus sign (+), a character class indicates a sequence of any length. So, `[0-9]+` indicates any sequence of digits, therefore any number. We can also specify the minimum and maximum length of the sequence, as in the second example below."

    "### Special characters\n",
    "\n",
    "Text imported from PDF or HTML documents, or from devices like mobile phones, may contain **special characters** like the left/right quotation marks (‚Äò, ‚Äú, etc), or the three-dot character (‚Ä¶), which is better to control, to avoid confusion. To keep this note short, I do not develop this point here, but mind that, if you capture string data on your own, you will probably find some of that in your data. Even if the documents are expected to be in English, they can be contaminated by other languages: Han characters, German umlaut, Spanish e√±e, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "Another source of trouble is that these special symbols can be encoded by different computers or different text editors in different ways. The preferred **encoding** is **UTF-8**, which is the default encoding in Macintosh computers. Reading and writing files text files in R, the argument `fileEncoding` allows you to mange allows you to manage both UTF-8 and the alternative encoding **Latin-1**. The problem with Windows computers is that they use a third system, called **Windows-1252**, which is very close to Latin-1, but not exactly the same. I cannot say more, because this topic goes beyond my expertise, so I do not discuss encodings in this course. If you are interested, you may take a look at Korpela (2006).\n",
