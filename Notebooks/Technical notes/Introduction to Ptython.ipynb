    "### General introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Python** is a programming language, introduced in 1991. We find it everywhere, and it is actually ranked second in the list of the most used programming languages, after JavaScript. It is said to be the preferred choice of the developers of malicious software (and those people are knowledgeable). \n",
    "\n",
    "There are currently two versions of the Python language: Python 2 and Python 3. This course uses version 3. Although all beginners are currently adopting Python 3, there is a lot of Python 2 code still in circulation, and many books base their explanations about how to do something in Python 2. Although most of the Python 2 code runs in Python 3, one finds trouble from time to time. So, it is recommended to check Python's version before starting to read a book or before copypasting somebody else's code.  \n",
    "\n",
    "In this course, we do not look at Python as a programming language, that is, for developing software applications, but from a data science perspective. About 2008, three libraries were added to the Python portfolio: Pandas, for managing data sets, Matplotlib, for plotting, and scikit-learn, for machine learning. This trio put Python in the data analytics arena. Since then, Python's popularity has been growing steadily among data analysts and, nowadays, it is the preferred tool for developing **machine learning models**. \n",
    "\n",
    "There are many distributions of Python. In the data science community, **Anaconda** (`anaconda.com`) is the favorite one. Anaconda distribution comes with the three libraries mentioned above. Downloading and installing Anaconda (choose Python 3 when the choice is presented to you) will leave you with the **Anaconda Navigator**, which opens in the browser and allows you to choose among different interfaces to Python. Once Anaconda is installed, you can bypass the navigator using a **command-line interface** (CLI), like Terminal on Mac computers or the Anaconda prompt on Windows. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among the many interfaces offered by Anaconda, I use for these notes the **Jupyter QtConsole**, which is an input/output text interface. Jupyter is a new name for an older project called **IPython**, so you may find in many places reference to the \"IPython console\", which is the same as the Jupyter QtConsole. \n",
    "\n",
    "An alternative approach is based on the **notebook** concept. In a notebook, you can combine input, output and ordinary text. In the notebook arena, the **Jupyter Notebook** is the leading choice, followed by **Apache Zeppelin**. These two are multilingual, that is, they can be used with other languages, like R, besides Python. Jupyter has powerful supporters and very smart people in the development team, so we will probably see plenty of Jupyter notebooks in the immediate future. Most pythonistas prefer the console for developing their code, but use notebooks for difussion, specially for posting their work on platforms like GitHub. This document is a Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the console, you can type or paste your code. When you open it, you find an input  prompt (such as `In[1]:`), where you can type a command and press `Return`. Then Python returns an output (preceded by `Out[1]:`), a (typically long and difficult) error message or no answer at all. A supersimple example:"

A module is just a text file that contains Python code (extension `.py`). Modules are grouped in libraries. These libraries are also called **packages**, because their elements are packed according to some specific rules that allow you to install and call them together. Python can be extended by more than 60,000 packages.\n",

    "The basic Python (without any package) is quite limited, so you need additional modules for practically everything. For instance, suppose that your math work goes beyond the above calculations, and you want to calculate the square root of 2. You will import first the module  `math`, whose resources include the square root and many other mathematical functions, and then apply the **function** `math.sqrt`. This notation indicates that `sqrt` is a function of the module `math`. In the console, the square root calculation shows up as:  "

    "### Learning about Python\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many books for learning about Python, but most of them would not be appropriate for learning how to work with data in Python. It can even happen that you do not find anything about data in many of them. Mind that Python has so many applications that the intersection of the know-how of all Python users is relatively narrow. For an introduction to Python as a programming language, in a computer science context, I would recommend Zelle (2010). For the self-learning data scientist, McKinney (2017) and VanderPlas (2017) are both worth their price. To those who are not afraid of manuals, I would recommend the Pandas manual (which is free).\n",
    "\n",
    "There is also plenty of learning materials in Internet, including MOOC's. For instance, **Coursera** has a pack of courses on Python (`coursera.org/courses?query=python`). But, probably, the most attractive marketplace for Data Science courses is **DataCamp**. They offer, under subscription or academic license, an impressive collection of courses, most of them focused on either R or Python (there are also a few ones on SQL). In addition to follow DataCamp courses, you can benefit from the **DataCamp Community Tutorials**, which are free and cover a wide range of topics. Also, a good place to start is `learningpython.org`.\n",
