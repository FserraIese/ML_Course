    "###  Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "**Employee turnover** in a company can come through normal means, such as retirement and resignation. The cause can be either voluntary or involuntary. Each industry has its own standards for acceptable turnover rates, and these rates can also differ between skilled and unskilled positions. However, there is more to employee turnover than a shrinking workforce. As employees leave an organization, they take with them skills which they developed during their tenure. Due to the expenses associated with training new employees, any type of employee attrition is typically seen to have a monetary cost.\n",
    "\n",
    "The data of this example have been collected by a Healthcare company to learn what factors lead to employee turnover. The data set contains information about 1,470 employees. The variables are:\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Turnover`, taking values 'No' and 'Yes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Age`, the employee's age, in years.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `BusinessTravel`, taking values 'Non-Travel', 'Travel_Frequently' and 'Travel_Rarely.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Department`, taking values 'Human Resources', 'Research & Development' and 'Sales'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Education`, education level, taking values 1 (Below College), 2 (College), 3 (Bachelor), 4 (Master) and 5 (Doctor).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `EnvironmentSatisfaction`, satisfaction with work environment, taking values 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High) and 4 (Very High).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Gender`, taking values 'Female' and 'Male'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `JobInvolvement`, the degree to which the employee is involved in his/her job, taking values 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High) and 4 (Very High).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `JobRole`, the job role, taking values 'Healthcare Representative', 'Human Resources', 'Laboratory Technician', 'Manager', 'Manufacturing Director', 'Research Director', 'Research Scientist', 'Sales Executive' and 'Sales Representative'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `JobSatisfaction`, the employee's satisfaction with his/her job, taking values 1 (Low), 2 (Medium), 3 (High) and 4 (Very High).\n",
    "\n",
    "* `MaritalStatus`, the employee's marital status, taking values 'Divorced', 'Married' and 'Single'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `Wages`, the employee's monthly gross wages in US dollars.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `CompaniesWorked`, the number of companies for which the employee has previously worked.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `OverTime`, whether the employee works overtime, taking values 'No' and 'Yes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `SalaryHike`, the percentage change in salary from 2016 vs 2015.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `PerfoRating`, the employee's performance, taking values 1 (Low), 2 (Good), 3 (Excellent) and 4 (Outstanding). It is reported by the employee's manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `StockOption`, whether the employee owns company stock, taking values 'No' and 'Yes'.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TotalWorkingYears`, the total number of years the employee has worked, across companies.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `TrainingLastYear`, the number of training activities in which the employee has participated during the last year.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `YearsAtCompany`, the number of years the employee has been working for the company.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `YearsInCurrentRole`, the number of years the employee has worked in his/her actual role.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `YearsSinceLastPromotion`, the number of years since the employee's last promotion.\n",
    "\n",
    "* `YearsWithCurrManager`, the number of years the employee has been working with his/her current manager.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Importing the data\n",
    "\n",
    "To import the data from the CSV file, I have to load first the Pandas library, which I call, as usual, `pd`. Then, the function `read_csv` imports the data to a data frame. In this case, the file is in a remote location (a GitHub repository). Note that I have broken the specification of the data source in two lines. This can be done in several ways, but the safest one is to use the backslash ('\\\\'), which in Python works as a **line continuation character**."

The data frame `df` is not specified as an argument of the function `describe`, but this function is written as if it were an attribute of `df`. The same for `round`, although in plain Python there is a function `round` which has the same syntax as in Excel (try `round(5.67, 1)` to see this."
